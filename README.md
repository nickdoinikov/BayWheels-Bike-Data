### Project Title
***Communicate Data Findings***

### Description
This project in the last part of the ***"Data Analyst Nanodegree"*** by Udacity. In this Project, I briefly wrangled and thoroughly analysed a dataset of the bike company BayWheels.
The two main goals of this project were:
_1. Perform **Exploratory Data Visualisation**._
This part of the analysis has multiple helps to do the following things:
  * understand the patterns and relationships present in the data;
  * perform statistical analyses;
  * build conclusions and findings
_2. Perform **Explanatory Data Visualisation**._
This part of the analysis has a goal of being able to communicate the results to others. This part is quite similar to the exploratory part, but requires much more visual polishing and explanation.


### Files used
I used the following files to accomplish the project:
* **README.md**;
* **ford.csv** - the database with all the trips' log data;
* **Project_Baywheels_Part1.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook containing **exploratory** visualisations;
* **Project_Baywheels_Part2.ipynb** - Jupyter notebook containing **explanatory** visualisations;
* **Project_Baywheels_Part1.html** - HTML version of the **exploratory** part;
* **Project_Baywheels_Part2.slides.html** - HTML (slide) version of the **explanatory** part;
* **output_toggle.tpl** - This file adds extra functionality to the slide deck by hiding the code to start, only making it visible if the reader clicks on the output.
Project;

### Credits
The **output_toggle.tpl** was downloaded from [damianavila's Github page](https://github.com/damianavila/blog/blob/master/posts/hide-the-input-cells-from-your-ipython-slides.ipynb)
Otherwise, during the preparation and the submission of the project, **no external source** was used during the submission.

Special thanks to the Udacity team for this project and its review!
